# RedditDemand — product purpose

**Search by problem, not by solution.**

- **What you type:** A *problem* the way people actually describe it (e.g. “I never have time to work on my side project”, “clients keep adding small requests”, “I forget to track hours and guess at the end of the week”).
- **What you get:** Where *real people* are talking about that problem (Reddit threads that match).
- **Why:** So you see evidence of demand before you build. Then you can brainstorm solution ideas — including silly or rough ones first — with the real problem in mind.

The search is semantic: it matches how people phrase the problem, not keywords. So query the way someone would complain or ask for help; that’s what surfaces the best threads.
